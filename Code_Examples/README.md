# Code Examples for LDD3 Notes

### What You Will Find Here

The examples you see here are ones that I had to create/modify that you probably won't be able to find an exact version of on someone else's repo.

### Other Good Repos

There appears to be a few people maintaining their own versions of the original LDD3 examples. Here are links to two really good repos to look at for the book examples:

- [Javier Martinez Canillas LDD3](https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3)
- [CU Boulder Fork of the Previous Repo](https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/ldd3) (this one can sometimes work better)

### How to Use These Files

I am currently using kernel 5.3.0-7648 to run these examples. Each individual example should have its own readme. In general, you should just have to run make in the main directory.
