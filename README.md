# LDD3-Notes
Notes on the book Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition, by Jonathan Corbet, Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. My notes from this book will attempt to add updated information for Linux 5.x.

Each chapter in the book is covered in detail in this note set. There is also a folder with example code to run some fun drivers as examples. See additional folders for more details.
